# PLANE CRASH INFORMATION

This data analysis project employs Tableau and MS Excel to investigate and visualize patterns within a diverse dataset of aviation incidents. Initial steps involve gathering and cleaning data, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Temporal trends are explored using both tools, examining patterns over months, quarters and years. Geo-spatial analysis in Tableau helps identify crash hot spots. The ultimate goal is to develop an interactive dashboard(s) in Tableau, providing users with a dynamic platform to explore the data, apply filters and gain insights. The dataset was collected from an external source.
